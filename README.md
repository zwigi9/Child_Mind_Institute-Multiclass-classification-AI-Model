# üèÜüìñ*Predicting Problematic Internet Usage Based on Physical Activity*

Welcome to our GitHub repository for the "Predicting Problematic Internet Usage" competition! This project aims to address a growing concern in today‚Äôs digital age‚Äîproblematic internet use among children and adolescents. By leveraging physical activity and fitness data, we strive to build a predictive model capable of identifying early signs of problematic internet behavior.

## Competition Overview

The goal of this competition is to analyze children‚Äôs physical activity data and predict their level of problematic internet usage. This initiative is critical in promoting early interventions that encourage healthier digital habits and prevent mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.

## Why This Matters

Traditional methods of measuring problematic internet use often involve complex clinical assessments, which can be inaccessible due to cultural, linguistic, or logistical barriers. On the other hand, physical activity and fitness data are widely available and require minimal intervention, making them ideal proxies for identifying problematic internet use. Excessive technology use often manifests through changes in physical behavior, such as reduced activity levels and poorer posture. By harnessing these indicators, we aim to create scalable solutions to this growing problem.

## Data Source

This competition utilizes data provided by the **Healthy Brain Network**, a mental health study conducted by the Child Mind Institute. This initiative is supported by the California Department of Health Care Services and sponsors like Dell Technologies and NVIDIA. The dataset includes valuable indicators such as:
- Accelerometer measures (e.g., X, Y, Z acceleration, and derived metrics like ENMO)
- Light exposure and time-of-day patterns
- Demographic and contextual features
