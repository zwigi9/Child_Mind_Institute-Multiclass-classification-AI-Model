# ü•áüóøOur Best and Final Attempt

## Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering üî®

- **Dataset Loading**: We started by importing the training and testing datasets using `pandas.read_csv`, ensuring data integrity for further analysis.

- **Cleaning and Feature Selection**:  
  - Removed unnecessary columns such as `id` and `Physical-Waist_Circumference` from both the training and testing datasets. 
  - Dropped rows in the training dataset with missing values in the target column `sii`, as they couldn't contribute to model training.

- **Feature-Target Splitting**:  
  - Defined features (`X_train`) by removing the target column `sii` from the training dataset.  
  - Assigned `sii` as the target variable (`y_train`) for supervised learning.

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - Merged two related columns (`PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total` and `PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total`) into a single composite feature `PAQ_Total`. This step consolidated similar data to reduce dimensionality and improve interpretability.  
  - Handled missing values in these columns by substituting them with zeros before merging.  
  - Removed the original columns post-merge to maintain a clean and concise feature set.  

This systematic approach to data wrangling and feature engineering optimized the dataset for robust model training, a critical skill in machine learning workflows.

```python
train = pd.read_csv(TRAIN_PATH)
test = pd.read_csv(TEST_PATH)

train = train.drop(columns=['id', 'Physical-Waist_Circumference'])  # Drop unnecessary columns
train = train.dropna(subset=['sii'])  # Remove rows with missing 'sii' values

# Split the cleaned training data into features (X) and target (y)
X_train = train.drop(columns=['sii'])
y_train = train['sii']

# Prepare test set
X_test = test.drop(columns=['id', 'Physical-Waist_Circumference'])  # Drop unnecessary columns

# Merge PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total and PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total in X_train
if 'PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total' in X_train.columns and 'PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total' in X_train.columns:
    X_train['PAQ_Total'] = X_train['PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total'].fillna(0) + X_train['PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total'].fillna(0)
    X_train = X_train.drop(columns=['PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total', 'PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total'])  # Drop the original columns

# Merge PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total and PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total in X_test
if 'PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total' in X_test.columns and 'PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total' in X_test.columns:
    X_test['PAQ_Total'] = X_test['PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total'].fillna(0) + X_test['PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total'].fillna(0)
    X_test = X_test.drop(columns=['PAQ_A-PAQ_A_Total', 'PAQ_C-PAQ_C_Total'])  # Drop the original columns
```
## Numerical Data Preprocessing ‚öô

- **Column Identification**:  
  - Determined common columns between the training and testing datasets using `.intersection()`, ensuring consistent feature usage.  
  - Identified numerical columns based on data types (`int64` and `float64`) and predefined relevant features, removing any mismatched columns for a unified preprocessing pipeline.  

- **Imputation Strategy**:  
  - Implemented the `SimpleImputer` with a median strategy to handle missing values in numerical columns, effectively reducing bias from outliers.  

- **Pipeline Configuration**:  
  - Utilized `ColumnTransformer` to apply the imputation only to the selected numerical columns.  
  - Transformed the training data and restructured it into a new DataFrame with proper column names for clarity and downstream processing.  

- **Test Set Integration**:  
  - Adjusted the imputer strategy to the mean and applied the preprocessor to both the training and testing datasets, ensuring consistency in handling missing values across datasets.  

This approach highlights our proficiency in preparing datasets for machine learning by seamlessly integrating feature selection, imputation, and column transformations, all while maintaining compatibility between training and testing data.

```python
common_cols = X_train.columns.intersection(X_test.columns)
numeric_cols_not_list = X_train.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.intersection(X_test.columns)
numerical_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')

numeric_cols = [
    "Physical-Height",
    "Physical-Weight",
    "Basic_Demos-Age",
    "SDS-SDS_Total_Raw",
    "Physical-BMI",
    "SDS-SDS_Total_T",
    "Physical-Systolic_BP",
    "Physical-HeartRate",
    "CGAS-CGAS_Score",
    "PreInt_EduHx-computerinternet_hoursday",
    "Basic_Demos-Sex",
    "Physical-Diastolic_BP",
    'PAQ_Total'
]

for col in numeric_cols:
    if col not in numeric_cols_not_list:
        numeric_cols.remove(col)

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_imputer, numeric_cols),
    ])
subset_x_train = X_train[numeric_cols]

X_train = preprocessor.fit_transform(subset_x_train)

# Create the DataFrame with proper column names
X_train_preprocessed_df = pd.DataFrame(X_train, columns=numeric_cols)

numerical_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_imputer, numeric_cols),
    ])

preprocessor.fit(X_train_preprocessed_df)
# Transform both training and test sets
common_cols = X_train_preprocessed_df.columns.intersection(X_test.columns)
X_train_preprocessed = preprocessor.transform(X_train_preprocessed_df)
X_test_preprocessed = preprocessor.transform(X_test[numeric_cols])
```
## Ensemble Modeling and Prediction üöÄ
This section highlights the steps taken to balance the dataset, train multiple machine learning models, and make class-specific predictions using an ensemble approach.
#### Balancing the Dataset
To address class imbalance in the training data, SMOTETomek was applied:

```python
smote_tomek = SMOTETomek(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote_tomek.fit_resample(X_train_preprocessed, y_train)
```
This technique combines SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Tomek links to oversample minority classes and clean noisy data.

### Model Training
Three machine learning models were employed:

Random Forest üå≤
XGBoost üìà
LightGBM ‚ö°
Each model was trained on the balanced dataset:
```python
rf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
xgb = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='mlogloss', random_state=42)
lgb = LGBMClassifier(random_state=42)

rf.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
xgb.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
lgb.fit(X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled)
```

### Custom Prediction Function using ensemble modeling
A custom prediction function was implemented to select the best-performing model for each class:
```python
def class_specific_predict(X, models, best_models_per_class):
    class_probabilities = np.zeros((X.shape[0], len(best_models_per_class)))
    for class_label in best_models_per_class.index:
        model_name = best_models_per_class[class_label]
        class_probabilities[:, int(class_label)] = models[model_name].predict_proba(X)[:, int(class_label)]
    return np.argmax(class_probabilities, axis=1)
```
The `best_models_per_class` dictionary specifies the optimal model for each class based on prior evaluation:
```python
best_models_per_class = pd.Series({
    0: 'Random Forest',
    1: 'Random Forest',
    2: 'Random Forest',
    3: 'LightGBM'
})
```
### Making Predictions and Submission
The custom prediction function was used to generate predictions for the test set:
```python
y_test_pred = class_specific_predict(X_test_preprocessed, models, best_models_per_class)
```
Finally, predictions were saved in the required submission format:
```python
submission_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': test['id'],  # Correct IDs from the test data
    'sii': y_test_pred
})
submission_df['sii'] = submission_df['sii'].astype(int)
submission_df.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
print("Saved to submission.csv")
```
This pipeline demonstrates the application of advanced ensemble modeling techniques, addressing class imbalance, and creating a robust prediction workflow for a multi-class classification task.

## Model Evaluation and Selection üèÜ
This section outlines the evaluation of machine learning models using Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), a metric that measures agreement between predicted and actual class labels (the evaluation method used in this Kaggle competition) , and the subsequent selection of the best model for each class.

### Validation Split
The resampled training data was split into training and validation sets to ensure robust evaluation:
```python
X_train_final, X_val, y_train_final, y_val = train_test_split(
    X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```
### QWK Performance Evaluation
Each model was trained on the final training set, and predictions were compared against validation labels to compute QWK scores for each class:
```python
for model_name, model in models.items():
    model.fit(X_train_final, y_train_final)
    y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
    for class_label in np.unique(y_val):
        qwk = cohen_kappa_score(
            (y_val == class_label).astype(int),
            (y_pred == class_label).astype(int),
            weights="quadratic"
        )
        performance_per_class_qwk[model_name][class_label] = qwk
```
The QWK scores were organized into a DataFrame for better visualization:
```python
performance_df_qwk = pd.DataFrame(performance_per_class_qwk).T
performance_df_qwk = performance_df_qwk.T
```
### Visualizing Performance
To compare model performance across classes, a grouped column chart was created:
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))
bar_width = 0.25
x = np.arange(len(performance_df_qwk.index))  # Class positions

# Plot each model's performance
for i, (model_name, color) in enumerate(model_colors.items()):
    ax.bar(
        x + i * bar_width,
        performance_df_qwk[model_name],
        bar_width,
        label=model_name,
        color=color,
        alpha=0.8
    )
```
The chart provides a clear visual representation of how each model performs for different classes.
### Selecting the Best Models
The best-performing model for each class was identified based on QWK scores:
```python
best_models_per_class_qwk = performance_df_qwk.idxmax(axis=1)
```
The results were printed for reference:
```python
print("Best model for each class based on QWK:")
for class_label, model_name in best_models_per_class_qwk.items():
    print(f"Class {class_label}: {model_name}")
```
This process ensured that the most suitable model was selected for each class, optimizing predictions for the multi-class classification task. The combination of robust evaluation metrics and intuitive visualization demonstrates a thorough and professional approach to model selection.

**It appears that the enrollment is nearly the same across all seasons. After testing, we came to the conclusion that it is better to not use season specific columns.**

**In our dataset, the majority of individuals use the internet for less than an hour, while those using it for more than 3 hours are quite few.**

**The pie chart above clearly shows that only 9.9% of people use the internet excessively, while the rest of the users either spend around 2 hours or less online.**

**The pie chart clearly shows that the majority of people, 58.3%, have no problems, while 26.7% experience only mild issues. This means that 85% of individuals in our dataset have either no problems or mild ones. In contrast, 15% of the population falls into more serious categories, with 13.8% having moderate problems and only 1.2% displaying severe issues. Therefore, in our dataset, only 1.2% of people have a severe problem, which is a very small percentage compared to the other three groups.**

</p>

**Here, we have a scatter plot for our target variable, SII, and the number of hours of internet usage. While the plot is interesting, it is also somewhat perplexing. It shows that all possible SII values are present across all ranges of internet usage hours per day, making it difficult to discern how the SII value changes with varying internet usage time. A potential solution to better understand this relationship would be to include a count of computer/internet users along with the SII and internet usage hours per day. This could help clarify the distribution and trend.**

**In the above chart, we have the SII, PreInt_EduHx-computerinternet_hoursday, and the count of PreInt_EduHx-computerinternet_hoursday. These three variables together provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data compared to the previous chart, which only used two features. By incorporating the count, we can better visualize and interpret the relationship between internet usage hours, educational history, and the severity of impairment.**

**The scatter plot above shows that the Sleep Disturbance Scale values for individuals with SII scores of 0, 1, and 2 fall within a similar range, with only a few outliers. For SII 3, we observe fewer entries, which can explain the smaller number of marks/dots in that section of the plot. However, even though there are fewer dots for SII 3, they still lie within the same range as those for SII 0, 1, and 2. The range for SII 3 is smaller compared to SII 0, 1, and 2, but I refer to it as the "same range" because there aren't a significant number of points outside the range of the other SII scores. A surprising finding is that for SII 3, we don't observe very high or very low sleep disturbance values. Ideally, we would expect SII 3 to correspond to higher sleep disturbance scores, but this isn't reflected in the data.**

**The violin plot illustrates the distribution of data points, showing that the majority of points fall within the sleep disturbance scale range of 30 to 50. This distribution appears quite similar for SII values of 0, 1, and 2. However, for SII value 3, the data points seem slightly fewer compared to those for SII values 0, 1, and 2.**

**The recorded values for BIA BMI and Physical BMI appear to be slightly different. There are two possible reasons for this:**

**1. There may be some discrepancy or error in the measurement of BMI.**

**2. The two BMIs could have been calculated at different ages for the same individual.**

# 1Ô∏è‚É£‚öíOur First Attempt 

Our first target was to make it work, just to have some reference for the future. 

## Handling missing features with sklearn's Simple Imputer

We started with dropping some unnecessery columns, which were: `id`, `sii`(target column) and `Physical-Waist_Circumference` (because it was mostly empty, more than 60%). Then we split the rest into numerical and categorical columns. After that we used SimpleImputer to handle missing data. For the numerical columns it was imputed with `median` value. And for the categorical columns we used `most_frequent` value. 

```python
# Step 1.1: Split the training data into features (X) and target (y)
X_train = train.drop(columns=['id', 'Physical-Waist_Circumference', 'sii'])  # Omit 'id', 'Physical-Waist_Circumference', 'sii'
y_train = train['sii']  # Our target is 'sii'

# Step 1.2: Split the testing data into features (X)
X_test = test.drop(columns=['id', 'Physical-Waist_Circumference']) # Omit 'id', 'Physical-Waist_Circumference',

# Step 2: Split the features into numerical and categorical based on data type
numeric_cols = X_train.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns
categorical_cols = X_train.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

# Step 2.1:Impute numerical columns with median value
numerical_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median')
train[numeric_cols] = numerical_imputer.fit_transform(train[numeric_cols])

# Step 2.2:Impute categorical columns with the most frequent value
categorical_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')
train[categorical_cols] = categorical_imputer.fit_transform(train[categorical_cols])
```
## Handling missing classes in target column with Random Forest Regressor

**We found out that there is a lot of missing classes in target column, around 30%.**

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9c942f3-17f4-4bea-b1eb-50887183bab3">
</p>

So, we decided on predicting missing classes with regressor. First, we separated rows with and without missing `sii`. Then we defined a preprocessor to encode categorical features using `One-Hot Encoder` (OHE) before training. We used this encoder instead of a simpler `Label Encoder` (LE), because LE can introduce unintended ordinal relationships for nominal data. In our case where every categorical feature is connected to the four seasons we didn't want it to have some sort of a hierarchical order. On the other hand, OHE creates binary columns for each category (no inherent order).

After that, we split the `train_no_missing` into features (X) and target (y). Next, we preprocessed the data and trained the Random Forest Regressor. Subsequently, we predicted the missing `sii` values and imputed these predictions into our main Data Frame. Lastly, we checked if all values where imputed correctly and did some basic model evaluation using `Mean Squared Error` (MSE).

```python
# Step 3: Separate rows with missing 'sii' and not missing 'sii'
train_no_missing_sii = train[train['sii'].notnull()]
train_missing_sii = train[train['sii'].isnull()]

# Step 4: Preprocess categorical features with one-hot encoding
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_imputer, numeric_cols),
        ('cat', Pipeline(steps=[
            ('imputer', categorical_imputer),
            ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False))
        ]), categorical_cols)
    ])

# Step 5: Split the train_no_missing into features (X) and target (y)
X_train_no_missing = train_no_missing_sii[X_train.columns]
y_train_no_missing = train_no_missing_sii['sii']

# Preprocess the data
X_train_no_missing_processed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X_train_no_missing)

# Train a Random Forest Regressor
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_no_missing_processed, y_train_no_missing)

# Step 6: Predict missing 'sii' values
X_train_missing = train_missing_sii[X_train.columns]
X_train_missing_processed = preprocessor.transform(X_train_missing)
predicted_sii = model.predict(X_train_missing_processed)

# Step 7: Impute the missing 'sii' values with the predictions
train.loc[train['sii'].isnull(), 'sii'] = predicted_sii

# Step 8: Check missing values after imputation
print("\nMissing values after imputation:")
print(train.isnull().sum())

# Evaluate the model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
X_train_no_missing_processed = preprocessor.transform(X_train_no_missing)
y_pred = model.predict(X_train_no_missing_processed)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_train_no_missing, y_pred)
print(f"\nMean Squared Error on training set: {mse}")
```
**Console output:**
```bash
Missing values after imputation:
id                                        0

```
We started by identifying common columns in train and test data sets, because test data set didn't have all of them. Then we updated the `numeric_cols` and `categorical_cols` variables so they only contained the common columns. After that, to avoid unnecessary errors, we had to define preprocessor one more time. Then, we preprocessed both the training and test data and trained the model with a simple `RandomForestClassifier`. Lastly, we predicted using the trained model on the preprocessed test data and save the results to `submission.csv`.

```python
# Step 9: Identify common columns
common_cols = X_train.columns.intersection(X_test.columns)

# Step 10: Handle numeric and categorical columns separately
numeric_cols = X_train.select_dtypes(include=['int64', 'float64']).columns.intersection(common_cols)
categorical_cols = X_train.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns.intersection(common_cols)

# For categorical features, apply one-hot encoding
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_imputer, numeric_cols),
        ('cat', Pipeline(steps=[
            ('imputer', categorical_imputer),
            ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore', sparse_output=False)) 
        ]), categorical_cols)
    ])

# Step 11: Preprocess both the training and test data
X_train_preprocessed = preprocessor.fit_transform(X_train[common_cols])
X_test_preprocessed = preprocessor.transform(X_test[common_cols])

# Step 12: Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train_preprocessed, y_train)

# Step 13: Predict using the trained model on the preprocessed test data
predictions = model.predict(X_test_preprocessed)

# Step 24: Prepare submission file
submission = pd.DataFrame({
    'id': test['id'],  # Assuming 'id' is the column in test.csv
    'sii': predictions.astype(int)  # Ensure predictions are integers (for classification)
})

# Step 25: Save to submission.csv
submission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)
print('Saved to submission.csv')
```

# üß™üî¨Further Testing using seaborn

## Feature Importance Analysis
After our successful first attempt we wanted to test if we need to use all the columns, so we created a feature importance plot to determine which ones are most important for our model.

</p>

According to this plot all of the categorical data (Seasonal data) was irrelevant. For a long time we'd used top 15 features from this plot. But when we used feature importance plot again, this time on our best performing model, the results quite differed.

</p>

Using the last plot as reference we finally ended up using following columns: `Physical-Height`, `Physical-Weight`, `Basic_Demos-Age`, `SDS-SDS_Total_Raw`, `Physical-BMI`, `SDS-SDS_Total_T`, `Physical-Systolic_BP`, `Physical-HeartRate`, `CGAS-CGAS_Score`, `PreInt_EduHx-computerinternet_hoursday`, `Basic_Demos-Sex`, `Physical-Diastolic_BP`, `PAQ_Total`.

## How to Handle 'sii' - Handling missing classes in target column. Part 2
Initially, in our first attempt, we used a `RandomForestRegressor` to impute missing values in the target column `sii` ([here](https://github.com/zwigi9/Child_Mind_Institute-Multiclass-classification-AI-Model/blob/main/README.md#handling-missing-classes-in-target-column-with-regressor)). Later, we considered an alternative approach: simply removing rows with missing `sii` values. After conducting several tests using the same model but handling the missing `sii` differently, we found that the best-performing method was to delete these rows. This approach proved effective, and we stuck to it for the remainder of the project.

## Parquet Files Adventures
### First Method using ThreadPoolExecutor
At first, we struggled with loading the Parquet files because the basic pandas functions couldn‚Äôt handle their large size within Kaggle‚Äôs runtime limits. After building a few simple models, we revisited the problem and searched online for solutions. We found a code snippet that appeared in multiple competition notebooks, offering a better way to process the time series data in Parquet format.

The snippet introduces a function, `load_time_series`, designed to efficiently handle Parquet files in a directory. It uses `os.listdir` to get the file names and `ThreadPoolExecutor` to process multiple files at the same time. Each file is passed to a helper function, `process_file`, which reads the Parquet file, removes the `step` column, and calculates summary statistics using `df.describe()`. These statistics include useful details about the data, such as how many values are present (count), the average (mean), how spread out the data is (standard deviation), and key percentiles (minimum, 25%, 50%, 75%, and maximum). These numbers give a quick but detailed picture of the data in each file. The statistics are flattened into a single row, and the file ID is extracted from the file name and included with the results.

The `load_time_series` function combines these rows into a DataFrame, where each column represents one of the statistics, and an `id` column identifies which file the data came from. This approach makes it much faster and easier to work with the time series data, as it turns large, complex datasets into compact summaries that are ready for modeling.

The resulting DataFrames are then merged with the main datasets (`train.csv`, `test.csv`) using the `id` column to match them. Once merged, the `id` column is no longer needed and is dropped, leaving the data clean and ready for analysis.

```python
import pandas as pd
import os
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
from tqdm import tqdm

def process_file(filename, dirname):
    df = pd.read_parquet(os.path.join(dirname, filename, 'part-0.parquet'))
    df.drop('step', axis=1, inplace=True)
    return df.describe().values.reshape(-1), filename.split('=')[1]

def load_time_series(dirname) -> pd.DataFrame:
    ids = os.listdir(dirname)

    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(tqdm(executor.map(lambda fname: process_file(fname, dirname), ids), total=len(ids)))
            
    stats, indexes = zip(*results)

    df = pd.DataFrame(stats, columns=[f"Stat_{i}" for i in range(len(stats[0]))])
    df['id'] = indexes

    return df

train_parquet_path = "series_train.parquet"
test_parquet_path = "series_test.parquet"

train_ts = load_time_series(train_parquet_path)
test_ts = load_time_series(test_parquet_path)

time_series_cols = train_ts.columns.tolist()
time_series_cols.remove("id")

train = pd.merge(train, train_ts, how="left", on='id')
test = pd.merge(test, test_ts, how="left", on='id')
